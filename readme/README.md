# Code Refactor Starter Code
When i first opened the project the style shit was not linked correctly and so was the image for the hero. Alot of css classes did share the same styles, so i condensed them into a shared class, which i named "one" and "primary". The header tabs all worked except the search optimization, which is not fixed.
